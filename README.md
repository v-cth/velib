I chose a topic that concerns many people: public transportation, using the case study of Velib', the bike sharing service in Paris. 

The goal of this data engineering project is to make service quality indicators of the service available to the public.

The API used is public:https://data.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/velib-disponibilite-en-temps-reel@parisdata/records
